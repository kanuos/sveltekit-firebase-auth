	<h1>Welcome to SvelteAdmin</h1>

		In this project, I'll demonstrate how to implement an authentication and authorization system
		that lets select ADMIN accounts to access the dashboard.

		As developers, we are always learning new stuff - frameworks, libraries, tools, tricks and so
		much more. It's important to journal these learnings so that we can gauge our progress. Blogging
		is probably the most common approach to keep a track of our progress. However, the content we
		publish should always be green flagged by you or your team. This not only results in consistent
		journaling but also prevents troll accounts to hijack your cms and start posting inane content.

		For the sake of simplicity - I won't be implementing the dashboard. However, the protected page
		can be replaced by your custom logic (e.g dashboard).
